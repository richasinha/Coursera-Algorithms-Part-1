dump APIs for hash table:

1. dumpIPHashTable keyType, subKeyType, vrf, ipv4, *ipv6

Usage:
keyType = 0 for IPv4 and 2 for IPv6
subkeyType : arp =1, local host = 2, vrrp = 3,ipv6 neighbor = 4 
vrf: 0 for base instance and so on
ipv4: address in hexadecimal format
ipv6: "2001::1" as example, don't forget to use the double quotes

If No arguments given: dumps IPv4 entries
if only key is given: dups info related to key
If both key and subkeyType is given: subset of both (key is needed when putting subKeyType else error)
info is based on the arguments.


2.  getIpHashBucket(ipv4 address in hexadecimal, vrf, 1)
-> Info related to this address

3.  getIpv6HashBucket(1st 32bit address in hex, 2nd 32 bit address in hex, 3rd 32 bit address in hex, 4th 32 bit address in hex, vrf, 1)
--> example : 2001::1
	getIpv6HashBucket 0x20010000,0,0,0x00000001,vrf,1 
	
4. dumpL3HashTable
--> dumps whole hash table
